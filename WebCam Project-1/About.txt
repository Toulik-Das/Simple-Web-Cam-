Accessing your webcam via your browser used to involve a...pardon the profanity, a plugin. That's right. In order to connect to a webcam and gain access to its video stream, you had to rely on something primarily created in Flash or Silverlight. While that approach certainly worked for browsers that supported plug-ins, it didn't help for the increasing number of browsers that aim to be plugin-free. This inability to natively access the webcam without relying on 3rd party components was certainly a gap in the HTML development story. At least, that was the case until pretty recently.

The W3C has been attempting to fill this gap by encouraging browser vendors to implement the proposals outlined in the Media Capture and Streams spec. This spec defines, among various other things, how to communicate with a webcam device using just a little bit of JavaScript. The good news is, despite its newness, various browsers have already implemented support for accessing the webcam in their latest versions.

Note: Browser Support
Because accessing the webcam natively is a recent introduction, check out caniuse's statistics to see the level of support it has among the major browsers.) In writing this tutorial, I used the latest version of Google's Chrome where everything works swimmingly.

So...while the rest of the world is getting upgraded to browsers that support native webcam access, now is a great time for you to get ahead of the program and learn all about it. That's where this tutorial comes in. By the time you reach the bottom of this page, you will have learned how to take your webcam's video stream and display it using only some HTML and JavaScript.

Onwards.
